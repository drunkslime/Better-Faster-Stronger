            2. To start the exercise prop your torso up on your elbows and your feet up on your toes.
            3. Keeping yourself completely straight, hold this position for as long as possible.

        '1. Begin the clean and press by placing a barbell on the floor in front of you and standing with your shoulders around shoulder width apart.
            2. After loading the appropriate weight, make sure the bar is positioned over the tops of your feet at the mid-way point (half way between your toes and heel).

            5. Look straight ahead and keep your back straight - make sure there is no arch in your lower back. You are now ready to begin the exercise.
            6. Explode upward through your legs and quickly snap the weight up to your chest level in one fluid movement.
            7. Continue the movement by pushing the weight straight above your head, using your shoulders and triceps to move the weight.
            8. Under strict control, lower the weight back to your chest and then back to the floor in the same fashion.
            9. Repeat for desired reps.',
        '1. To avoid injury, correct form is paramount with this exercise! Practice good form before loading on the weight.

        '1. Set up for the smith machine shoulder press behind the neck by setting a bench down in the smith machine and adjusting the back to a 90-degree angle.
            2. Sit down on the bench and adjust the position so that the bar comfortably comes down just behind your head.
            3. Add the weight you want to use and sit down on the bench.
            4. Un-rack the weights and bend your elbows slightly. This is the starting position for the movement.
            5. Slowly begin lowering the bar down behind your neck as far as comfortably possible.
            6. Once your upper arms are slightly past parallel to the floor, pause, and then slowly raise the barbell back up without locking the elbows out at the top of the movement.
            7. Repeat for desired reps.',
        '1. To help avoid injury, do not lower the bar much further than the top of your head when bringing the bar down behind you. This will keep your arms at a 90-degree angle to the floor and place less stress on your shoulder joints.
            2. Keep your back straight throughout the movement. Don\'t let it arc too much when pressing the weight.
            3. Use a lighter weight than you would on a regular barbell press.
            4. Use slow and controlled movement, both when pressing and when lowering the weight.',

        '1. Lie flat on a bench and set your hands just outside of shoulder width.
            2. Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench.
            3. Take a deep breath and allow your spotter to help you with the lift off in order to maintain tightness through your upper back.
            4. Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off.
            5. Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows.
            6. Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest.
            7. Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.
            8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.',
        '1. Technique first, weight second - no one cares how much you bench if you get injured.
            2. Keep the bar in line with your wrist and elbows and ensure it travels in a straight line. In order to keep the wrist straight, try to position the bar as low in the palm as possible while still being able to wrap the thumb.
            3. If you want to keep more tension through the triceps and chest, stop each repetition just short of lockout at the top.
            4. Don’t worry about tucking the elbows excessively, much of this advice is from geared lifters using suits. A slight tuck on the way down may be advisable for some lifters but other lifters can use an excellent cue from Greg Nuckols that will accomplish the same thing: “Flare and push”.
            5. Arching may be advisable depending upon your goals but ensure that most of the arch comes from the mid to upper back and not your lower back. If your lower back is cramping as you set up for the lift, you’re out of position and putting yourself at risk for potential injury.
            6. The bar should touch your chest with every single repetition. If you want to overload specific ranges of motion, look into board presses or accommodating resistance with chains or bands.
            7. As the bar descends, aim for your sternum (breastbone) or slightly below depending upon the length of your upper arm in order to promote a linear bar path.
            8. Intermediate and advanced lifters may use a thumbless or “suicide” grip but for the majority of lifters, it would be wiser to learn how to bench with the thumb wrapped around the bar at first.
            9. Fight to the urge to allow the wrists to roll back into extension, think about rolling your knuckles toward the ceiling.
            10. Experiment with grip width - if your have longer arms you may need to use a slightly wider grip. However, if you’re feeling pressure in the front of the shoulder during the exercise, you may need to widen your grip, improve scapular retraction, or slightly lessen the range of motion via exercises such as floor or board presses.
            11. Squeeze the bar as tightly as possible to help enhance shoulder stability.
            12. Some lifters prefer to tuck their toes while other prefer to keep the feet flat in order to optimize leg drive - experiment with both and see which one feels and allows for greater power production.
            13. Ensure the shoulder blades remain retracted and don’t allow them to change position as you press.
            14. The bar should descend under control and touch the lifter’s chest - no bouncing or excess momentum.
            15. Think about trying to push yourself away from the bar instead of pushing the bar off of you.
            16. Tightness through the upper back should be one of your main priorities throughout the course of the lift.
            17. Ideally, use a spotter to help assist with the lift off in order to maintain tension through the upper back.
            18. Keep the feet quiet throughout the lift and utilize leg drive by pushing your feet into the floor and squeezing your glutes to stabilize the pelvis.
            19. Focus on pulling the bar apart or trying to “bend the bar” in order to activate some of the intrinsic stabilizers in the shoulder.
            20. The glutes and shoulder blades should maintain contact with the bench throughout the entirety of the movement.',
